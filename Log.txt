Read location from DB and added it as dropdown select items

Next time:

    - Custom claim to determine user account or business account that is logged in
    to know if user should be forwarded to home page (only normal user can stay
    loggined in)

To do:

Render gifts based on selection
Render and add municipals as drop down selection to filter gifts
Business creation and login page
Remove adding admin functionalities from source code *IMPORTANT*
Change cloud function servers to Canada if possible? doesnt matter if data not stored?

Bug:
    - Determine account login type and route to appropiate page 
    (ex. user acc to user home and business acc to business home)
    - Redirect user to user home page only after SUCCESSFUL signup

MAJOR Bug:
    - On refresh userHome page, uid is undefined, history.push() works though
    - after logging in with business with approvedShop role, and then logging out,
    an unapproved business can login and still be redirected to approved page
